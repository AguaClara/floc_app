OpenCV Tutorial

Installation
Most tutorials will instruct you to download XCode or Homebrew, but the simplest way is to:
1. Install Anaconda
  MAC: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/installing-anaconda-mac-os-x
  WINDOWS: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/ 
2. Type <<conda install -c anaconda opencv>> into the terminal 
This will enable you to use OpenCV with Jupyter Notebook (an open-source web application that can share live code between collaborators). 

To use Jupyter Notebook, open up your terminal and navigate to the directory where your file lives. Then type <<<jupyter notebook>>> and your terminal will automatically open up a new webpage in your browser with the folder of your choice. Then, choose the file you need and a new page will open with your file using jupyter notebook.
