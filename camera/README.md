# NSAViewer — Somebody's watching you.

With this webcam snapshot application you can take photos of what is currently
being viewed by your webcam. Uses the Qt QtMultimedia framework for handling
all the interaction with the camera, and supports multiple cameras if you have
them.

> If you think this example app is neat and want to learn more about
PyQt in general, [take a look at my ebook & online course
"Create Simple GUI Applications"](https://martinfitzpatrick.name/create-simple-gui-applications)
which covers everything you need to know to start building your own applications with PyQt.
